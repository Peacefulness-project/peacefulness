# A converter transfers energy from one aggregator (upstream) of energy A to another aggregator (downstream) of energy B.
# For the downstream aggregator, it looks like a conversion point, but, for the upstream aggregator, it looks like a device.
# The main difference between a conversion point and a device is the following: when the device is a "customer" for the aggregator, it is the aggregator who is the customer of the conversion point.
