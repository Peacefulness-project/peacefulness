# this daemon is designed to calculate a very unaccurate dynamic temperature of the cold water in housings during a year.
# according to a report of ADEME (french institute working on the energetic transition), the min temperature is 9째C (we choose February) and the max is 21째C in August
# knowing that, we built a linear function going from 9 to 21 to get one temperature per month
